# Assistive Safety Device for Vulnerable Individuals

## Background
Children, elderly individuals with dementia, and non-verbal users often struggle to seek help when lost or in danger in crowded public spaces such as theme parks.

## Problem
- Difficulty in requesting help verbally
- Delayed response in emergency situations
- Existing solutions are either too complex or inaccessible

## Idea Overview
A wearable device with a simple physical button.
- Pressing the button alerts nearby staff
- Multiple presses escalate the alert level
- Designed for environments with trained staff (e.g., theme parks)

## Target Users
- Children
- Elderly individuals with dementia
- Non-verbal or language-barrier users

## Research Direction
- Human-centered design
- Fail-safe interaction
- Cost constraint (~$50)

## Current Status
Concept & research planning stage.
